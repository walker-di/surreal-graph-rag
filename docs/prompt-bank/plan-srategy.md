else in the plan.

the plan has to be very detailed, step by step implementation plan (example:
docs\plans\ux\0001-file-inteface.md)

Audit checklist:

- ✅ Svelte 5 runes usage ($state, $derived, $effect, $props)
- ✅ Modern event handling (onclick vs on:click)

it. this is is another reason to focus on one thing

the files has to be distributed correctly under for exports. please check
package.json

this is for JUNIR developers so it has to be very detailed and easy to follow.
